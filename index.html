   <h1>APPETIZERS</h1> 
   <ul>
    <li><h2>Tunisian shorba frik</h2></li>
    <p> it is not only a delicious meal with hearty ingredients such as frik and meat, but it is also water-based </p>
    <li><h2>Tunisian brik with parsley and egg</h2></li>
    <p>As soon as the brik are ready, squeeze some lime juice over the top and dig in. As you crunch into the fried wrapper, it should start to flake. Then the egg should coat your tongue as the brininess of the tuna comes into play.</p>
    <li><h2>Tunisian cucumber salad</h2></li>
    <p>This salad is often served with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, olives and finished off with a healthy glug of olive oil. Finally, it's more likely to be eaten with a hunk of crusty baguette rather than a fork</p>
   </ul>
   <h1>MAIN COURSES</h1>
   <ul>
    <li><h2>Makrouna</h2></li>
    <p>Nothing screams Tunisia like this spicy beef pasta. With chickpeas and potatoes, it is also one of the most carb-loaded (i.e. amazing) of the Tunisian pastas. You can pretty much use any cut of meat, bone-in or boneless!
    </p>

<li><h2>Tunisian mint tea</h2></li>
<p>At first it was a drink of the elites, but in the years that followed, it democratized and became a drink for all classes. Tea in Tunisia, however, is a bit of a different story. </p>

<li><h2>Cornes de gazelle</h2></li>
