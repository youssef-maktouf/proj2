    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Tunisian shorba frik</h2>
        </li>
        <p> it is not only a delicious meal with hearty ingredients such as frik and meat, but it is also water-based
        </p>
        <li>
            <h2>Tunisian brik with parsley and egg</h2>
        </li>
        <p>As soon as the brik are ready, squeeze some lime juice over the top and dig in. As you crunch into the fried
            wrapper, it should start to flake. Then the egg should coat your tongue as the brininess of the tuna comes
            into play.</p>
        <li>
            <h2>Tunisian cucumber salad</h2>
        </li>
        <p>This salad is often served with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, olives and finished off with a healthy glug of
            olive oil. Finally, it's more likely to be eaten with a hunk of crusty baguette rather than a fork</p>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="red-border"><a name="MAIN COURSES"></a>MAIN COURSES</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Makrouna</h2>
        </li>
        <p>Nothing screams Tunisia like this spicy beef pasta. With chickpeas and potatoes, it is also one of the most
            carb-loaded (i.e. amazing) of the Tunisian pastas. You can pretty much use any cut of meat, bone-in or
            boneless!
        </p>
        <li>
            <h2>Tunisian loubia</h2>
        </li>
        <p>Looking for a Super Bowl Sunday chili recipe? Why not try our recipe for Loubia. It’s almost like/kind of the
            Tunisian/spicy version of chili and perfect for winter days. </p>
        <li>
            <h2>rouz djerbi</h2>
        </li>
        <p> Rouz Djerbi is a balanced and healthy meal composed of steamed rice, a ton a vegetables, and a protein of
            your choice</p>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Tunisian citronnade</h2>
        </li>
        <p>This particular recipe has a hint of orange blossom water and will transport you to summer days of yore.</p>
        <li>
            <h2>Tunisian mint tea</h2>
        </li>
        <p>At first it was a drink of the elites, but in the years that followed, it democratized and became a drink for
            all classes. Tea in Tunisia, however, is a bit of a different story. </p>
        <li>
            <h2>Tunisian baklawa</h2>
        </li>
        <p>Originating from the Ottoman empire, baklava is a dessert made of layered phyllo dough filled with nuts and
            covered in sticky syrup.</p>
        <li>
            <h2>Cornes de gazelle</h2>
        </li>
        <p>Give these cornes de gazelle to any of your favorite people and watch as their faces light up in delight as
            they take a bite into the flaky, sweet, aromatic treats. The tiny explosion of snowy powdered sugar that
            follows each bite is an added bonus.</p>
    </ul>
